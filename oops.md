# what is data structure?
A data structure is storage format that defines the way the data is stored, organized and manipulated.
Some popular data structures are arrays, trees and graphs.

# What is an array?
The Array object is a collection of items stored together as a sequence in memory locations.

# Linked List
Linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored together memory locations. A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

# Stack 
Stack is a linear data structure that performs operations in LIFO order. In a stack,elements can be accessed from the topmost to bottom element.

# LIFO 
last in first out
it is a way of accessing, storing and retrieving data.

# Queue
Queue is a linear data structure that performs operations in FIFO order.

# FIFO
first in first out. it is a way of accessing, storing and retrieving data.

# what are binary trees?
Binary trees are an extension of the linked list structure. they have two nodes all the times, a left node and the right node.( children of the node)

# what is recursion?
recursion refers to a function calling itself based on a terminating condition. it uses lIFO and therefore makes use of the  stack data structure.

# Object Oriented programming (OOP) 
is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. 
Object: Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. 
Class: Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity out of which an object can be created or instantiated. 
Inheritance: A concept that refers to an object acquiring all the properties of a parent object. It provides code reusability. 
Polymorphism: A concept that allows task to be performed in different ways.
Abstraction: a concept that hides the internal details of an application and only show its functionality. we use abstraction and interface to achieve abstraction.
Encapsulation: A concept that binds the code and data together in a single unit.

# Explain doubly linked lists?
Special type of linked list in which the data elements can be traversed in both directions. 
This is made possibly by having two links in every node , one that links to the next node and another one that connects to the previous node.

# Differences between linear and non-linear data structure
Linear - A structure in which the data elements are adjacent to each other. Ex: arrays, linkedlists,stacks and queue
Non Linear- A data structures in which data items are not arranged in a sequence. Ex: trees and graphs

# what is a deque?
A Deque is a double ended queue. this is a structure in which elements can be inserted or removed from either end.

# difference between stack and array


# different types of sorting algorithms
bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort, balloon sort.

# How does variable declaration affect memory?
Amount of memory to be allocated or reserved depends on the data type being stored in that variable.

# What are dynamic data structures?
Structures that expand and contract as the program runs. It provides flexibility means of manipulating data because it can adjust according to the size of the data.

# what is a struct? . Difference btwn struct and class
Struct is a customized datatype that contains other data types. 
Structs are value type whereas Classes are reference type. // 2 points are enough
Members of a class are private by default,to make it public we need to add the public modifier. In struct, by default members are public, if we need any private members, we have to use a modifier. 
Value types hold their value in memory where they are declared, but reference type holds a reference to an object memory.
Struct cannot have a default constructor (a constructor without parameters) or a destructor. where as classes can have.
# Explain the concept of Inheritance?
Inheritance is a concept where a child class can access method of base class. Inheritance can be acheived by extending a parent class or by using interfaces

# What are different modifiers in languages?
Public, private, protected and default
